**Project Name:** SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Machine Learning Prediction

**Project Overview:** 

SpaceX aims to make space travel more affordable by reusing rocket boosters. The primary objective of this project is to predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will successfully land, using data collected from SpaceX launches. Predicting successful landings is crucial for SpaceX as it reduces costs and enables the reuse of rocket boosters.

**Key Objectives:**

- Collect and explore SpaceX launch data.

- Perform data wrangling and visualization.

- Apply machine learning models to predict successful landings.

- Interpret and evaluate the model's performance.

**Dataset:** 

The dataset contains information about SpaceX launches including: Launch date and location, rocket type and payload mass, launch outcome (success/failure), orbit type.

**Tools and Libraries:**

- Python

- Pandas, NumPy (Data manipulation and analysis)

- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly (Data visualization)

- Scikit-learn (Machine learning)

- Dash (Interactive dashboards)

**Methodology:**

- Data Collection: Retrieve SpaceX launch data via APIs and web scraping.

- Data Preprocessing: Clean and transform the dataset for analysis.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify patterns and relationships in the data.

- Feature Engineering: Create relevant features to improve model accuracy.

- Model Development: Train machine learning models to predict landing outcomes.

- Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Results:**

- Developed a predictive model to classify Falcon 9 landing outcomes.

- Identified key factors influencing successful landings (e.g., payload mass,

**Future Work:**

- Improve model accuracy with advanced algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, Neural Networks).

- Integrate real-time SpaceX API for live predictions.

- Enhance the dashboard with more interactive features.
